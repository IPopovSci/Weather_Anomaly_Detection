### Introduction

The objective of this project is to utilize the OPTICS, Local Outlier Factor, and Isolation Forest models to detect dates with abnormal weather conditions. Additionally, we investigate general weather trends across seven cities to gain insights into how climate change impacts different regions at varying rates.

### Technologies and libraries

* Tableau
* Kaggle Notebooks
* Python
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn

### Use

You can access the Tableau dashboard, which showcases the data and identified anomalies, either in the project files or through this link: [Dashboard Link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ivan.popov2140/viz/WeatherTrendsAndAnomalyDetection/GlobalTrends).

The notebook containing the data preparation and anomaly identification using machine learning models is available within the project files or can be found on Kaggle at the following link: [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ivanpopovkablamo/weather-anomaly-detection).

Furthermore, the project includes the utilized data, the weather API interface (https://open-meteo.com/), and utility scripts for data processing.
